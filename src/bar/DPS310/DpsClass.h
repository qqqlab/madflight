/**
 * Arduino library to control Dps3xx
 *
 * "Dps3xx" represents Infineon's high-sensitive pressure and temperature sensor.
 * It measures in ranges of 300 - 1200 hPa and -40 and 85 째C.
 * The sensor can be connected via SPI or I2C.
 * It is able to perform single measurements
 * or to perform continuous measurements of temperature and pressure at the same time,
 * and stores the results in a FIFO to reduce bus communication.
 *
 * Have a look at the datasheet for more information.
